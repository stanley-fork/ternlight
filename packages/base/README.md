# @ternlight/base

**On-device semantic embeddings for JavaScript. 7 MB on the wire, ~5 ms per embedding, zero API calls.**

A 1.58-bit (BitNet-style ternary) sentence encoder compiled to WebAssembly. Give it text, get back a 384-dimensional unit vector for semantic search, FAQ matching, deduplication, clustering, or RAG reranking — computed entirely on the user's CPU. No network, no GPU, no ML runtime, no model download at runtime: the model ships inside the wasm.

```bash
npm install @ternlight/base
```

```js
import { embed, cosineSim, similar } from '@ternlight/base';

// embed() → Float32Array(384), L2-normalized — compare any two with a dot product
cosineSim(embed('reset my password'), embed('I forgot my password'));              // 0.88
cosineSim(embed('how do I cancel my order'), embed('I want to cancel my purchase')); // 0.82

// or top-K semantic search over any list of strings
const results = similar('how do I reset my password', faqEntries, { topK: 3 });
// [{ text: 'Resetting a forgotten password', sim: 0.82 }, ...]
```

Works in Node ≥ 18, browsers (via any bundler), Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, and Bun — one package, the right loader is picked automatically.

**Why on-device?** No 100–300 ms API round-trips — search-as-you-type feels instant. No per-call billing. Queries never leave the device. Works offline.

## Quality & footprint

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Wire size (gzipped wasm) | **~7 MB** |
| Embed latency (p50, M-series CPU) | **4.9 ms** |
| Teacher fidelity (Spearman vs all-MiniLM-L6-v2) | **0.844** |
| Retrieval (SciFact NDCG@10) | **0.465** |
| Output | 384-dim, L2-normalized |

The model is distilled from [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with quantization-aware training — weights are ternary {-1, 0, +1}, the embedding table is int4, and the from-scratch Rust engine runs on WASM SIMD.

**Need smaller/faster?** [`@ternlight/mini`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ternlight/mini) is the same API at ~5.5 MB and <2 ms, trading some quality (0.835 Spearman).

## API

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `embed(text)` | → `Float32Array(384)`, unit-length. Sync, ~5 ms. Truncates at 128 tokens. |
| `cosineSim(a, b)` | Cosine similarity of two embeddings (a dot product — they're normalized). |
| `similar(query, corpus, { topK })` | Embed query + corpus, return top-K `{ text, sim }` sorted. |
| `engineInfo()` | Build/model info string — dimensions, quantization format. |
| `TernError` | Typed error (`INVALID_INPUT`, `DIM_MISMATCH`). |

For repeated searches, embed your corpus once and reuse the vectors:

```js
const index = docs.map((d) => ({ d, v: embed(d.text) }));
const q = embed(query);
index.sort((a, b) => cosineSim(q, b.v) - cosineSim(q, a.v));
```

## Bundler setup (browsers)

The wasm is imported as an ES module. Webpack 5 needs one flag; Vite needs the wasm plugin:

```js
// webpack.config.js
experiments: { asyncWebAssembly: true }

// vite.config.js
import wasm from 'vite-plugin-wasm';
export default { plugins: [wasm()] };
```

Node needs nothing — `require()` or `import` and go.

## How it works

Three ideas stacked: **(1)** a small transformer student is distilled from MiniLM *while being trained as a ternary model* (QAT), so quantization costs almost nothing; **(2)** ternary weights pack to 2 bits each, putting the whole model + tokenizer + engine in one wasm file; **(3)** the forward pass is hand-written Rust compiled to WASM with explicit SIMD, so it runs at near-native speed in every JS runtime.
