# training/distill

Stage 1 of the training pipeline: distill a small ternary student from a frozen teacher. Produces a `.pt` checkpoint that `training/pack/` consumes.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd training/distill
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 1. One-time: build the cached training dataset
python prep/prepare.py --config configs/micro.yaml

# 2. Train (uses GPU if available)
python train.py --config configs/micro.yaml

# 3. Run go/no-go eval suite on the final checkpoint
python evaluate.py --checkpoint runs/micro-qat-1M-60ep/checkpoint_ep60.pt
```

`prep/` is the only sub-package — it's a discrete one-time setup phase with multiple files. The training files (model, trainer, loss, quantization) stay flat at root because they're tightly coupled to one another. `data.py` and `config.py` are cross-phase contracts.

## Training pipeline

The pipeline has four phases. Phases 2 and 3 are both invoked through `train.py`; the only difference is which config you pass.

| Phase | Action | Entry point | Key knobs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Data prep | Multi-source mix → tokenize → teacher encode → `.pt` cache | `prep/prepare.py --config <yaml>` | source mix, sample count, teacher id |
| 2. Float32 baseline | Distillation in pure fp32. Establishes the architecture ceiling. | `train.py --config configs/micro-fp32.yaml` | epochs, batch size, LR |
| 3. QAT training | Float32 warmup → BitLinear ternary. Same distillation loss + contrastive guardrail. | `train.py --config configs/micro.yaml` | warmup_epochs, lambda schedule, loss weights |
| 4. Post-train eval | Apply ternary projection to embedding, run Tasks 1/2/3, emit GO/MARGINAL/NO-GO. | `evaluate.py --checkpoint <run>/checkpoint_ep<N>.pt` | quant_embedding (default on) |

Phase 2 is the **ruler**, phase 3 is the **ship**: phase 3 is what we deliver, phase 2 only exists so we can measure how much QAT costs vs. an unconstrained architecture.

## Post-training evaluation (Phase 4)

`evaluate.py` runs three tasks against a checkpoint. Critically, the embedding table is post-train ternarized first — `nn.Embedding` is untouched during QAT, but the shipped `.bin` is ternary, so eval has to apply the same projection to be honest.

| Task | What it tests | Source | Pass threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Teacher Alignment | Per-sample cosine sim vs. teacher | 2,000 held-out MS MARCO queries | mean > 0.75 |
| 2. STS-B Ranking | Does the model rank pairs like humans? | `mteb/stsbenchmark-sts` test (1,379 pairs) | AUC > 0.80 |
| 3. Recall@3 | End-to-end retrieval | `corpora/general.jsonl`, `corpora/tech.jsonl` | min(general, tech) R@3 > 0.70 |

Decision table:
- Any **FAIL** → NO-GO; rethink architecture
- Any **MARGINAL** with no FAIL → retry with `configs/small.yaml` (d_model=384)
- All **PASS** → GO; proceed to `training/pack/` for the .bin export

## Math reference

Forward pass, backprop, loss formulation, why each design choice was made — all in [../../docs/training/model-internals.md](../../docs/training/model-internals.md). The Phase 2 postmortem ([../../docs/training/postmortem-bitlinear-asymmetry.md](../../docs/training/postmortem-bitlinear-asymmetry.md)) covers what the *real* BitLinear forward pass computes — relevant when modifying `quantization.py` because the same math has to apply identically in `training/pack/pack.py` and `engine/src/inference.rs`.

## Status

Pre-alpha — code migration from `tern-distill-prototype/poc/` pending.
