Distilled from [`all-MiniLM-L6`][minilm], with [BitNet b1.58][bitnet] style quantization-aware training. Three core design choices stack to fit an embedding model in 7 MB:

- **Ternary weights.** Every weight is one of three values: `-1`, `0`, or `+1`. Inference becomes add and subtract, no matmul operations. Quality holds because the model is trained for ternary weights from the start, not quantized after the fact.
- **One bundle.** Model and full BERT tokenizer pack into a single WASM file. `npm install` and you're done — no postinstall step, no runtime fetch.
- **SIMD inference engine.** Inference engine is written in Rust and compiled to WASM with SIMD. Add/subtract math leans on CPU vector instructions.

## Overview

A 2-layer Transformer encoder, trained with quantization-aware distillation and int4-quantized at the embedding layer.

| Spec         |                                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundle       | 7 MB (engine + 4.6 MB model + 695 KB tokenizer, all inside one `.wasm`) |
| Output       | 384-dim L2-normalized vector                                            |
| Max input    | 128 tokens (~95 English words)                                          |
| Architecture | 2-layer Transformer · d_model=256 · 4 attention heads                   |
| Parameters   | ~9.5M                                                                   |
| Targets      | Node 18+, modern browsers with WASM SIMD, edge runtimes                 |
| License      | MIT                                                                     |

## Install and usage

```bash
npm install ternlight
```

```js
import { embed, cosineSim, similar } from 'ternlight';

// One primitive: turn a string into a 384-dim L2-normalized vector
const v1 = embed("arctic terns migrate from pole to pole");
const v2 = embed("longest migration in the animal kingdom");

cosineSim(v1, v2);   // ~0.71 — same concept, different words

// Nearest-neighbor search over a corpus
const matches = similar("which seabird travels farthest", [
  "arctic terns migrate from pole to pole",
  "puffins dive underwater for fish",
  "how to debounce a search input",
], { topK: 2 });
// → [{ text: "arctic terns...", sim: 0.78 },
//    { text: "puffins...",      sim: 0.31 }]
```

> **Status:** v0.1 (pre-alpha). The engine works end-to-end and matches Phase 1 quality baselines. Packaging, performance polish, and public release are still in progress. Not yet on npm.

## Why this exists

On-device embedding unlocks:

- **Search-as-you-type.** Results appear before the user finishes typing. Faster than any network round-trip can be.
- **Privacy-sensitive apps.** Queries and documents never leave the device — no data-handling agreements, no leak risk.
- **Offline-first apps.** Browser extensions, Obsidian plugins, desktop apps.
- **Edge-runtime apps.** Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge. Embeddings co-locate with your request handler — no separate inference service to call.
- **Edge devices and IoT hardware.** Raspberry Pi, single-board computers, industrial gateways, kiosks. Add/subtract math runs efficiently on ARM cores — no GPU or NPU required.
- **Static sites.** Jekyll, Hugo, Astro. Ship the model with the bundle; semantic search works without a backend.

## Contributing

There's still tons of headroom for perf and quality improvements. Beyond stacked encoders, I'm curious about other modalities, specially generative use cases that fit the same tight constraints. JS, Rust, and ML contributors all welcome.

## Acknowledgments

ternlight builds on three open-source efforts:

- **[BitNet b1.58](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764)** (Ma et al., Microsoft Research, 2024) — the architectural research underlying ternary weight training.
- **[`bitlinear`](https://github.com/schneiderkamplab/bitlinear)** by [@schneiderkamplab](https://github.com/schneiderkamplab) — the reference PyTorch implementation of BitLinear. We use it directly during training (`bitlinear==2.4.6`) and the Rust inference engine mirrors its forward-pass math byte-for-byte.
- **[`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** — the teacher model the student is distilled from.

The Rust engine in [`engine/src/kernels.rs`](engine/src/kernels.rs) is an independent reimplementation of `bitlinear`'s `BitLinear.forward()` for the WASM target; parity tests guard against drift.
