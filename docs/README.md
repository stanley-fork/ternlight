# Documentation

In-depth concepts and methodology behind ternlight. For end-user usage, see
[`packages/ternlight/`](../packages/ternlight). For build and contribution
notes specific to one component, see the README in that directory.

## What's here

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [overview.md](overview.md) | Project overview — what ternlight is, how the three technical choices stack, when to use it |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | System design — the `.bin` format, runtime model, packaging pipeline |
| [inference-engine.md](inference-engine.md) | Runtime internals — engine layout, BitLinear forward pass, tokenization path |
| [model-internals.md](model-internals.md) | Canonical math reference — forward pass, backprop, distillation dynamics |
| [eval-methodology.md](eval-methodology.md) | Quality scorecard methodology — each metric, how to reproduce it |
