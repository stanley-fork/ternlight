## 2. Core Architecture Pillars

Three technical choices stack to fit a capable embedding model into a 7 MB WASM bundle that runs on CPU.

### Pillar 1: Quantization-aware training (QAT) with ternary weights

All Linear layers in the student are **BitLinear layers** — weights are constrained to three values: `{-1, 0, +1}` plus a single fp32 scale per matrix. The model is trained with that constraint from the start using the [BitNet b1.58][bitnet-paper] straight-through estimator, so quality holds up where naive post-training quantization would collapse.

At inference time this means:

- No floating-point matrix multiplication — only integer additions and subtractions
- Weights pack at ~1.58 bits per parameter (log₂(3)); practical packing overhead brings this to ~2 bits
- Quality stays within ~95% of the full-precision baseline (see [`eval/quality/RESULTS.md`](../eval/quality/RESULTS.md))

The model is an encoder — it produces a single fixed-size embedding vector per input, not autoregressive token predictions.

### Pillar 2: Bit-packing — model + tokenizer in one WASM bundle

Weights serialize at ~2 bits per parameter (four weights per byte), with the embedding layer optionally further compressed via 4-bit per-row PTQ. The whole model fits into a binary file you can embed *inside* the `.wasm` itself:

- The model `.bin` embeds at compile time via Rust's `include_bytes!()` macro
- The HuggingFace `tokenizers` crate compiles into the same `.wasm` — tokenization happens inside Wasm, not in JS
- The BERT WordPiece vocabulary embeds at compile time via the same mechanism — no separate vocab file ships
- No postinstall, no runtime fetch — `npm install` and you're done

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokenizers = "0.19"
```

The resulting `.wasm` is ~7 MB total: 4.6 MB packed model + 695 KB tokenizer + ~1.7 MB engine code.

**License:** the HuggingFace `tokenizers` crate is Apache 2.0.

### Pillar 3: SIMD inference engine in Rust → WASM

The engine is not a generic inference framework. It is a **hardcoded computation graph** compiled from Rust to WebAssembly with `+simd128`. It:

- Allocates a single contiguous block of linear memory at startup
- Maps the model `.bin` sequentially into that memory (no deserialization)
- Executes each layer in order using branchless bitwise operations
- Uses 128-bit WASM SIMD lanes for vectorized add/subtract over bit-packed rows

The ternary matmul reduces to sign-conditioned add/subtract that maps directly onto CPU vector instructions — fast by construction, not by tuning. No plugin system, no dynamic dispatch, no model-agnostic abstraction; the engine is structurally coupled to the specific layer shapes defined in the `.bin` header.

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn embed(text: &str) -> Vec<f32> {
    let encoding = TOKENIZER.encode(text, false).unwrap();
    let ids = encoding.get_ids();
    // → forward pass → embedding vector
}
```

## 3. Model Format: The `.bin` File

The exported model is a single binary file with a minimal header:

```
Offset  Size    Field
──────────────────────────────────────────────
0       4B      Magic number (0x5445524E — "TERN")
4       2B      Format version
6       2B      d_model
8       2B      n_layers
10      2B      n_heads
12      2B      ffn_dim
14      2B      vocab_size
16      2B      max_seq_len
18      2B      Reserved
20      4B      Total weight bytes (excluding header)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
24      N bytes Bit-packed weight matrices (sequential)
```

Weight matrices are stored in layer order: embedding table, then for each layer — Q, K, V, O projections, FFN up, FFN down, layer norm scales. All values are 2-bit encoded with four weights per byte.

## 4. Training & Distillation Pipeline

The training pipeline is strictly separated from the runtime. PyTorch and GPU infrastructure are training-time concerns only — nothing from the training environment ships in the package.

### Phase A: Distillation Training (Python / GPU)

1. **Teacher model:** A high-quality sentence transformer (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) generates soft embedding targets for the training corpus.
2. **Student model:** A 2-layer BitLinear transformer defined in PyTorch. Uses float32 shadow weights during training to enable gradient computation.
3. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT):** The forward pass uses the sign function to project shadow weights to `{-1, 0, +1}` (with a zero-band threshold). Gradients flow through the shadow weights via the straight-through estimator.
4. **Loss:** Cosine embedding loss between student and teacher output vectors, trained on a focused English/tech-domain corpus matching the target use case.

### Phase B: Export & Bit-Packing (Python Script)

1. **Discard training state:** Float32 shadow weights and all optimizer states are deleted.
2. **Materialize ternary weights:** Shadow weights are projected to `{-1, 0, +1}` and stored as integers.
3. **Pack:** Every four ternary values are packed into one byte using 2-bit encoding (`00` = 0, `01` = +1, `10` = -1, `11` = unused/padding).
4. **Write:** The 24-byte header is prepended and the file is written as a raw `.bin`.

### Phase C: Inference (Wasm)

`embed(text: &str) -> Vec<f32>` is the entry point. Inside the engine:

1. **Tokenize** — BERT WordPiece via the compiled-in `tokenizers` crate (vocab embedded at build time). Returns token IDs, truncated to `max_seq_len = 128`.
2. **Embedding lookup** — each token ID indexes the (int4-quantized) embedding table; per-row scales restore the fp32 activation magnitude.
3. **Forward pass** — 2 transformer layers (attention + FFN, ternary weights throughout).
4. **Mean-pool and L2-normalize** → 384-dim unit vector.

## 5. Target Model Configuration (Micro Tier)

The micro tier is the default and primary build target. See [tern-model-sizing.md](tern-model-sizing.md) for full sizing rationale.

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| d_model | 256 |
| n_layers | 2 |
| n_heads | 8 (d_k = 32) |
| ffn_dim | 1024 (4× d_model) |
| vocab_size | 10,000 |
| max_seq_len | 128 |
| Total params | ~7M |
| Packed model size | ~1.75MB |

### Tier Configurations

| Tier | d_model | n_layers | Params | Packed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| nano | 128 | 2 | ~3M | ~750KB |
| **micro** *(default)* | **256** | **2** | **~7M** | **~1.75MB** |
| base | 384 | 2 | ~12M | ~3.0MB |

All tiers share the same Wasm engine binary. The engine reads dimensional constants from the `.bin` header at startup and allocates memory accordingly.

### Wasm Binary Size Breakdown

The `tokenizers` crate adds to the compiled Wasm size. Estimated breakdown:

| Component | Estimated Size |
|---|---|
| Inference engine (Rust) | ~400KB |
| `tokenizers` crate (compiled) | ~200–300KB |
| BERT vocab embedded (`include_bytes!`) | ~115KB |
| **Total Wasm binary** | **~715–815KB** |

> **Risk:** The `tokenizers` crate pulls in `regex`, `unicode-normalization`, and `serde`. These compile cleanly to Wasm but tree-shaking is not guaranteed. A test compile should be done early in Phase 2 to get a real binary size number before committing to the vocab-embedded approach.

---

## 6. Runtime Performance Model

A single `embed()` call runs **~218M operations** per input string. The compute splits cleanly between ternary weight matmuls and a small float-multiply tail.

**Ternary add/subtract — ~201M ops (~92%).** Every learned matrix is bit-packed weights, so every weight matmul reduces to add/sub:

| Stage | Per 2 layers |
|---|---:|
| Q/K/V/O projections | ~33.6M |
| FFN (up + down, 256 ↔ 1024) | ~134.4M |
| Embedding scale + readout | ~33.6M |
| **Total** | **~201.6M** |

**Float multiply — ~17M ops (~8%).** Bounded to operations over *activations* (which can't be ternarized) plus per-token non-linearities:

| Stage | Ops | Why float |
|---|---:|---|
| Attention scores (Q @ K.T, attn × V) | ~16.8M | Both operands are float activations |
| Softmax, scaling, LayerNorm × 5, GELU × 2 | ~780K | Transcendentals + per-token statistics |

**The 92/8 ratio is the key result.** The dominant share is integer add/sub, which maps directly to SIMD lanes. The remaining 8% is geographically isolated to attention-score computation — small enough that further quantization offers diminishing returns.

### Why ternary add/sub is fast on CPU

A ternary matmul inner loop looks like:

```
for each weight:
    if weight == +1:  accumulator += input[i]
    if weight == -1:  accumulator -= input[i]
    if weight ==  0:  skip
```

- **No multiply unit needed.** Float add is 1 CPU cycle, float multiply is 3–5 cycles. Ternary matmul is 3–5× cheaper per operation than float matmul.
- **Branch-free implementation.** The weight encodes a sign bit — the add/subtract decision can be computed without branching: `accumulator += input[i] * weight` where weight is literally -1, 0, or +1. The multiply by ±1 is optimized away by the compiler.
- **The zero weights (skip) are free sparsity.** At ~45% zero fraction (from the scaled training run), nearly half the operations are skipped entirely. Effective op count is closer to ~120M than 218M.

### Cache behavior — the key advantage at this model size

The entire packed model is ~2.7MB. Modern CPUs have:

```
L1 cache:   ~128KB   — holds current layer's activations
L2 cache:   ~4–12MB  — holds the ENTIRE model
L3 cache:   ~32MB+   — irrelevant, everything fits in L2
```

For comparison, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` at float32 is ~88MB — it constantly evicts L2 and hits L3/RAM. @tern's model fits entirely in L2 cache from the first call onward. Every weight read is a cache hit.

**What this means in practice:**

- First call may be ~10ms (cold cache, loading .bin into L2)
- Subsequent calls ~3–8ms (everything in L2, no RAM access)
- The bottleneck shifts from memory bandwidth to raw ALU throughput

### Estimated latency targets

| Environment | Estimated latency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Native Rust (M4 Max) | ~1–2ms | Baseline reference |
| Wasm in Node.js (V8) | ~5–15ms | Wasm sandbox overhead |
| Wasm + SIMD (V8) | ~2–5ms | Future optimization |
| Cloudflare Workers | ~5–20ms | Depends on cold/warm |
| Browser (Chrome/Firefox) | ~5–15ms | Comparable to Node.js |

These are estimates based on op count and typical Wasm overhead factors. Real numbers will come from Phase 2 benchmarks. The scoping doc targets 1–5ms — achievable with SIMD, likely 5–15ms without.
